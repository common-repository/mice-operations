= Do I need a MICE Operations account? =

A MICE Operations account is required. However, the plugin also allows you to embed widgets from other organizations on your WordPress site. A free 14 day trial is available on our website.

== Installation ==

After installation you can instantly start using the MICE Operations Widget on your website. Simply add a link to the widget and it will automatically be embedded on your page. There are two options to embed the widget.

1. Popup wizard: Add a regular link to the widget, anywhere on your page or in your navigation. When the link is clicked the beautiful wizard interface will appear. A widget link looks like https://app.miceoperations.com/widget/c62782778039.
2. Embedded: Add a widget link, but add `#embed` to the end of the link, so it looks like https://app.miceoperations.com/widget/c62782778039#embed. The widget form will be embedded like as if it were a part of your page. Please be aware that using embed links outside of the page/post content could lead to unexpected behaviour!

= Floating button =

In the WordPress settings menu you will find a "MICE Operations" section. Here you can configure the widget's 'floating button' option. After setting this up a button will be added to the bottom left/right of your screen on each page, allowing users easy access to your widget.

1. Add a Widget ID to enable the floating button in the bottom of each page or leave blank to disable the floating button by default.
2. Select your brand's primary color.
3. Optionally configure a couple of layout settings.

The Widget ID can be overridden per page, so you can added separate widgets to different sections of your website.

You're all set up!
